# Udacity hotel reservation app

This is my implementation of the first (out of three) project in Udacity's Java Programing Nanodegree.

## TODO
- [x] Catch exceptions later in UI?
- [x] Ensure that entered check in date is earlier that check out date
- [x] Fix duplicate booking
- [x] Refactor suggesting other dates
- [ ] Sort elements in collections when printing them (reservations, customers)
- [ ] Add option to add a class for free room
- [x] Make classes final where applicable
- [x] Check PROJECT SPECIFICATION
- [ ] Add variables' values to exception messages
- [ ] When dates are printed to console, truncate time
- [ ] Play with dock blocks: try generating the doc file

## NEW FEATURES
- [ ] Customize the find-a-room method to search for paid rooms or free rooms.
- [ ] Provide a menu option from the Admin menu to populate the system with test data (Customers, Rooms and Reservations).
- [ ] Allow the users to input how many days out the room recommendation should search if there are no available rooms.
